    <p>A sequel to 2018's God of War was teased at the end of that game; it ended with Ragnarök looming, as well as a secret ending that showed a vision of Thor confronting Kratos and Atreus at the end of Fimbulwinter. Although he did not officially announce a new game at the time, that game's director, Cory Barlog, confirmed that the 2018 installment would not be Kratos's last game, and it was later revealed that future games would continue to be set in the Norse environment and include Atreus. In April 2019, a teaser came in the form of a PlayStation 4 (PS4) dynamic background theme; the side of Kratos and Atreus's boat had runes that translated to "Ragnarök is coming". At the same time, in order to celebrate the first anniversary of the previous game's release, Barlog posted a thread of tweets on Twitter with pictures and a statement concerning the development process; some fans noticed that the first letter of each tweet spelled out "Ragnarök is coming". During the 2020 PlayStation 5 (PS5) Showcase event on September 16, a new God of War was officially announced for a 2021 release on the newer console. The short trailer, which had a voice over by Kratos actor Christopher Judge, did not officially reveal the name of the sequel, but just like the previous teasers, the trailer stated that "Ragnarök is coming". This led some sources to believe the title of the game to be God of War: Ragnarök, but at the time, this was not confirmed by Sony. The tagline implied that this would be the start of Ragnarök in the God of War universe, which in Norse mythology is a series of events that bring about the end of days and the deaths of the Norse gods.</p>

    <p>When the game was first announced in September 2020, it was only announced as a PS5 title. However, after Sony Interactive Entertainment revealed their plans to support their previous console until at least 2022, speculation began on whether the new God of War would see a cross-gen release on the PS4, as some other titles that were originally thought to be PS5 exclusives were also announced to release on PS4 (e.g., Horizon Forbidden West). In June 2021, it was confirmed that the game would release on both the PS4 and PS5, in turn marking the first cross-gen release in the series. After the 2018 installment was ported to Windows (PC) in January 2022, Barlog was questioned on if Ragnarök would see a PC release, but he was unsure, stating it was Sony's decision, but did say they learned a few things about porting to PC if they were to do it again.</p>
    <p>By February 2021, neither Sony nor the game's developer, Santa Monica Studio, had given any updates regarding the game's release, prompting Barlog to tweet that the game would be out "when it's done". In June 2021, head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, stated that Sony had decided to delay the game until 2022 to ensure that Santa Monica could deliver on their desired gaming experience for players. Santa Monica Studio issued a statement regarding the game's delay, which said that while they were focused on delivering a top-quality game, they also wanted to maintain the safety of those involved with the development. The game's music composer, Bear McCreary, who also composed the music for the previous game, responded to the news of the delay, saying that it would be worth the wait.</p>
    <p>Development was partly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as Hulst stated that there were issues getting access to performance capture and talent. The delay also brought a unique issue with Atreus actor Sunny Suljic, who was going through puberty during the time of production. His voice had changed a lot, especially during the delay, according to supervising dialogue designer Jodie Kupsco, who said "We had to go in and even out that performance so [that in the game] it sounds like it took place over a short period of time". Senior producer Ariel Angelotti said there were no changes to cinematics as a result of the delay, they just had to get creative in how they made the content. In following pandemic guidelines, Angelotti said that they had actors "stand in" for other characters in some scenes. For example, an actor for a main character would stand in as a background character "to be able to avoid a situation where too many people were on-set". In a series of tweets posted by Judge in late September, he said that he was the reason that the game was delayed due to surgery he needed in August 2019. Judge said that Santa Monica allowed him time to recover and waited for him to rehabilitate before continuing production. He also revealed that he had briefly quit the game after finding out that Eric Williams would be directing the sequel. Judge was uncertain about Williams; however, Barlog, who served as a producer and creative director on Ragnarök, was able to convince Judge that Williams was fully capable of directing the game, which Judge affirmed after working with him.</p>

    <p>During Sony's May 2021 investment filing, they included a title treatment for the game which stated the title as God of War: Ragnarök, although the investment filing was later changed to state only "God of War". A report found that the logo used in the filing was unofficial and fan-made. Following this, various media outlets were uncertain of the legitimacy of the title of the game. In a statement to IGN, a Sony representative stated that the game's logo and title were not yet finalized or official, and that the inclusion of the false logo in the investment filing was an error. However, the game's title was in fact confirmed to be God of War Ragnarök (without a colon) during the 2021 PlayStation Showcase event on September 9.</p>
    <h2>Casting</h2>
    <p>During the 2021 PlayStation Showcase event, game director Eric Williams revealed that Richard Schiff would portray Odin. Other casting announcements included Ryan Hurst as Thor, Ben Prendergast as Týr, Laya De Leon Hayes as Angrboda, and Usman Ally as a dwarf named Durlin. In addition to Christopher Judge and Sunny Suljic returning as Kratos and Atreus, respectively, it was confirmed that Danielle Bisutti and Alastair Duncan would be reprising their respective roles as Freya and Mímir, and that Robert Craighead and Adam J. Harrington would reprise their respective roles as the Huldra Brothers, Brok and Sindri. SungWon Cho also announced that he would be providing the voice and motion capture for the squirrel Ratatoskr, and worked directly with the writers to write his scenes. A day before release, Scott Porter revealed that he played Heimdall, and the game's music composer, Bear McCreary, was also confirmed to play a Dwarf musician named Ræb.</p>
    <p>Unlike the popular portrayal of Thor by Chris Hemsworth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the Thor in Ragnarök looks closer to his depiction in Norse mythological literature, having a hefty build with long red hair and beard. This type of portrayal was similarly done for the other Norse gods such as Odin himself, shown as a softly spoken and somewhat friendly middle aged man, as in the literature, the Norse gods were not as flashy as the Greek gods were. In portraying Thor, Hurst took inspiration from another Marvel Comics character, Hulk, citing his rage and power. He also took inspiration from Tommy Lee Jones' character in No Country for Old Men (2007), Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, noting how he was a powerful character that harbored regret.</p>
    <h2>Pre-release fan backlash</h2>
    <p>Following the announcement that Ragnarök had been delayed to 2022, Santa Monica's developers received harassment from some fans, including threatening messages. The delay was announced shortly after Alanah Pearce revealed her involvement on Ragnarök. Pearce was blamed for the delay and she received threatening messages of sexual harassment. Cory Barlog came to her defense—and all of Santa Monica's developers—stating that he made the call to delay the game and that it had nothing to do with lower-level staff. Furthermore, after a rumor circulated that Santa Monica would reveal the release date towards the end of June 2022, and that date passed, some developers received explicit images from angry fans in an attempt to get them to reveal the release date.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the reveal that Angrboda would be black was controversial to some fans. They claimed that since the game is set in Scandinavia, she should have been white. The developers, however, defended the decision due to the diversity of the Dwarves in the game, among other changes such as Mímir having a Scottish accent, and the fact that the character of Angrboda is of a mythological race with a power of transformation.</p>
    <p>There was also some backlash to the reveal that Ragnarök would be released on both the PS4 and PS5 due to concerns that the PS4 version would hold back the PS5 version. Comparing the situation to what happened with 2007's God of War II, which had released exclusively on the PlayStation 2 although the PlayStation 3 had already been out for a few months, Barlog said that despite not releasing on the newer console at the time, it still worked out well for that game.</p>
    <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
    <p>God of War Ragnarök (Original Soundtrack) was released on November 9, 2022, by Sony Classical Records and was also included in the game's special editions. It was composed by Bear McCreary, returning from the previous game. The soundtrack features Faroese singer Eivør on the tracks "God of War Ragnarök", "Holding On", "Svartalfheim", "Pull of the Light", and "Remembering Faye". McCreary had previously featured Eivør on the 2018 installment's soundtrack.</p>
    <p>Irish folk artist Hozier is featured on the track, "Blood Upon the Snow", which was Hozier's first contribution to a video game soundtrack. Hozier was particularly interested in working on the song as he was a fan of the series and also interested in the maturing medium of digital arts. He was also familiar with McCreary's other works. Due to Hozier being signed with Sony's Columbia Records in the United States, he was approached by Sony to contribute to Ragnarök. To help in composing the song, the game's director Eric Williams talked Hozier through the character arcs of Kratos and Atreus. Hozier was also inspired by nature and the natural world. In working with McCreary, Hozier said they were able to find a balance so that the song was "not too elegiac, not too much of an elegy, not too sweet, not too lullaby-esque, not too outrageously doom and gloom, and not too absolutely metal". Paolo Ragusa of Consequence described the song as "a daring, cinematic number that hits at all the thematic notes of God of War: Ragnarök, and finds Hozier using his signature velvety tone to evoke both tenderness and awe". Hozier and McCreary performed the song live at The Game Awards on December 8, 2022.</p>
