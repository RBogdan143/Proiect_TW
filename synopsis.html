    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <p>Like the 2018 installment, Ragnarök is set in the world of Norse mythology, taking place three years after the previous game. While only six of the nine realms of Norse mythology could be explored in the 2018 game, Ragnarök sees the player exploring each of the nine realms, and unlike the previous installment, all nine realms are visited as part of the story; the fiery realm Muspelheim and the fog realm Niflheim, now covered with ice and snow, were previously just optional realms to explore. The other returning realms include Alfheim, the home of the dark and light Elves, Helheim, the land of the dead, and Jötunheim, the land of the Giants. Midgard, the primary realm of the 2018 installment, has become a frigid wasteland, dramatically changed by Fimbulwinter, a three-year long winter that began upon the conclusion of the previous game. The Lake of the Nine, previously navigable by means of a boat in the previous game, is now frozen over. Previously inaccessible realms include Svartalfheim, the industrial abode of the Dwarves; Vanaheim, the lush home of the Vanir gods as well as the giant wolves Sköll and Hati; and Asgard, the humble home of the Æsir gods that is only visited as part of the story and cannot be accessed after its conclusion.</p>
    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>The main protagonists are Kratos (played by Christopher Judge) and his teenage son, Atreus (Sunny Suljic). Kratos is the former Greek God of War, while Atreus is half Giant, one-quarter god, and one-quarter mortal and is also referred to by his Giant name, Loki. Since the conclusion of the previous game, Kratos and Atreus have been in hiding at their home in Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard, training for the inevitable battle ahead of them. Other major characters include Mímir (Alastair Duncan), the smartest man alive and the pair's loyal companion, providing knowledge and counsel; Freya (Danielle Bisutti), a Vanir goddess, former Queen of the Valkyries, and Odin's ex-wife, also known as Frigg, who seeks revenge against Kratos and Atreus for the death of her son, Baldur; the Huldra Brothers, Brok (Robert Craighead) and Sindri (Adam Harrington), a pair of dwarven blacksmiths who assist Kratos and Atreus by forging new gear and also found a way to travel to other realms without using the realm travel table in Týr's Temple; and Angrboda (Laya De Leon Hayes), one of the last remaining Giants who had been in hiding in Jötunheim in a secluded forest called the Ironwood and protecting its animals.</p>

    <p>The game's primary antagonist is the Aesir god Odin (Richard Schiff), the king of Asgard and Allfather of the Nine Realms. An unseen character in the previous game, he is a pathological liar and manipulator obsessed with preventing his death at Ragnarök and will take any means to stop it. He lost an eye while looking into a rift between worlds in hopes of finding answers to prevent the catastrophic event. His ravens, including Huginn and Muninn, allow him and the Aesir to travel freely to any realm, and they are his watchful eyes over the realms. Thor (Ryan Hurst), the Aesir God of Thunder and eldest son of Odin, serves as a secondary antagonist; he is the half-brother of Baldur and father of Modi and Magni, all of whom Kratos and Atreus killed in the previous game. He wields the hammer Mjölnir, with which he slays Giants, despite being part-Giant himself, and does the bidding of his father despite being constantly belittled by him. Another antagonist is the Aesir god Heimdall (Scott Porter), another son of Odin and half-brother to Thor who has a superiority complex and believes himself to be untouchable due to his foresight ability. Known as the "Herald of Ragnarök", he watches over Asgard for threats, rides atop the horse Gulltoppr, and possesses the magical horn Gjallarhorn that signals the start of Ragnarök and opens simultaneous realm travel to Asgard. A minor antagonist is Grýla (Debra Wilson), Angrboda's estranged grandmother in Jötunheim who steals animal souls to experience their memories.</p>

    <p>Other characters include Freyr (Brett Dalton), Freya's Vanir twin brother who has been leading a resistance against Odin and the Aesir in Vanaheim; Týr (Ben Prendergast), the Norse God of War but a peaceful one who was thought to have been killed by Odin prior to the events of the previous game; Sif (Emily Rose), Thor's golden-haired Aesir wife who wants Thor to stand up to Odin; Thrúd (Mina Sundwall), the daughter of Thor and Sif who dreams of becoming a Valkyrie and is unaware of Odin's true nature; the three Norns, who are the Fates of Norse mythology—Urð (Kate Miller), the Norn associated with the past, Verðandi (Emily O'Brien), the Norn associated with the present, and Skuld (Shelby Young), the Norn associated with the future; Surtr (Chris Browning), a fire Giant who lives in Muspelheim; and Kratos's second wife—Atreus's mother—Laufey (Deborah Ann Woll), a Giantess who goes by Faye for short and had died shortly before the start of the previous game—in Ragnarök, she appears in flashbacks to Kratos, preparing him for her death and her final wish, which was the basis of the previous game.</p>
    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Near the end of Fimbulwinter, Kratos and Atreus return home—fending off an ambush from a vengeful Freya—to find their wolf Fenrir in his final moments. Atreus's grief transforms him into a bear through his still-uncontrolled Giant and godly magic, briefly battling Kratos before returning to his senses. Thor arrives with Odin, who proposes leaving them alone if Atreus abandons his secret search for Týr. Kratos refuses and duels Thor to a stalemate, but Odin tells Atreus he will leave Kratos alone if the former comes to Asgard. Kratos, Atreus, and Mímir take refuge at Sindri's home on a branch of Yggdrasil in the center of the nine realms.</p>

    <p>Atreus admits he and Sindri have been searching for clues about Týr's whereabouts. Kratos reluctantly agrees to help Atreus; they travel to Svartalfheim and rescue a pacifistic Týr. The group head to Gróa's shrine in Alfheim to understand the prophecy concerning Ragnarök, and learn Gróa lied: only Asgard is fated to being destroyed but all other realms survive under a new champion, implied to be Atreus using the name Loki.</p>
    <p>Kratos and Atreus argue over the latter's supposed destiny. That night, Atreus is magically transported to Jötunheim where he meets the Giantess Angrboda, who shows him a mural foretelling Kratos' death in Ragnarök and Atreus serving Odin. Atreus learns the Giants transferred their souls into spiritual stones; he is entrusted with them and puts a Giant's soul into a snake's body. Atreus returns to Midgard, where he and Kratos are attacked by Freya. She agrees to spare Kratos if he helps her break the curse binding her to Midgard—she circumvents it by taking form as a falcon. In Vanaheim, where Freya's estranged brother Freyr leads a resistance against Odin, Kratos opens up to Freya about his first family's deaths in Greece and the emptiness of revenge. After breaking the curse, Freya and Kratos make amends.</p>

    <p>Kratos and Atreus argue regarding the latter's deceitful behavior; Atreus flees to Asgard to find a way to prevent Kratos's death. Odin requests his help in preventing Ragnarök by reassembling an ancient mask that can supposedly grant infinite knowledge. Meanwhile, Kratos, Freya, and Mímir visit the Norns, who say Heimdall is destined to kill Atreus. Kratos and Brok forge the Draupnir ring into a powerful spear, capable of harming Heimdall. In Helheim, Atreus releases the soulless giant wolf Garm, who begins tearing holes in the realms. After reuniting with Kratos, Atreus, realizing Fenrir's soul was bound to his knife when he died, resurrects Fenrir by transferring his soul into Garm. Kratos and Atreus then reconcile. With Mímir and Freya, they return to Vanaheim to rescue Freyr from the Aesir. Kratos is forced to kill Heimdall and claims Gjallarhorn, setting Ragnarök in motion...</p>
