    <p class="container">God of War Ragnarök on PS5 received "universal acclaim", according to review aggregator Metacritic, garnering a score of 94/100. This ties it with both the original 2005 installment and the 2018 installment for the highest Metacritic score in the series. The game was praised for its storytelling, characters, visuals, level design, and overall improvements to the gameplay over its predecessor. Most reviewers agree that it excelled over the 2018 installment in many aspects, and that it was a fitting end to the Norse era of the series. The game was, however, subject to minor criticism, such as the excessive hints during puzzles, as well as some gameplay mechanics.</p>
    <p class="container">Tamoor Hussain of GameSpot opined that out of all the many different takes on Norse mythology, Ragnarök's is "easily one of the most memorable", and it is elevated due to Kratos and his past life as a Greek god and the perspective that brings. He said the most impressive things about the game were the "exploration of loss and love; grief and growth; [and] determinism and defiance". He added that the game was well-written and it takes Norse mythology, deconstructs it, and rebuilds it as an epic story about families. Although the game is long, he claimed that the "writing and characterization" made the length worth it. Kyle Hilliard at Game Informer wrote that although Ragnarök did not have the same unique impact that the 2018 installment had, everything that worked well in that prior game is here, and along with the story, the sequel is truly an "epic". Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell, however, felt that because Ragnarök tried to include as much of the series history as possible, the game can feel "both bloated and crowded". The bloat is what he said was the game's biggest problem, as the story could have been told in half the time. However, he positively noted that due to its length, it meant that there was more of the game to play. He also positively compared it to a theme park, due to the many different things that can be experienced in the game.</p>
    <p class="container">Writing for IGN, Simon Cardy said that Ragnarök provided fresh interpretations of well-known Norse mythological characters, such as Odin and Thor, and the unique take and the portrayal by the actors did not have Cardy thinking about their popular MCU counterparts. Hussain elaborated that because of the blurred line between good and evil, the characters are compelling throughout the story, and because the game has players empathizing with the antagonists, it makes the "story so captivating". He also said that the "superb writing and acting" made the interactions between Kratos and Atreus, as well as Mimír, more interesting, coming off their experiences in the previous game. Hilliard was also impressed with the writing, stating it "outdoes the already fantastic dialogue of the 2018 game". He also said that surprisingly, it was the funniest God of War to date.</p>

    <p class="container">While praising the RPG elements for allowing players to cater to their own play style, Hussain said there was nothing "game-changing or innovative" in the system. Tapsell had a similar opinion, saying that while there were some new ideas and there are some fun character builds that could be made, nothing is really memorable or expressive like in other RPGs, and players can get by without engaging much with it. Cardy, however, said the system was more streamlined which made it easier to see what all the player has equipped, and felt the game encouraged players to make their own custom builds. He praised it for being accessible and not overwhelming. Writing for PCMag, Clay Halton was critical of the system, stating it was the game's "most tedious aspect", as it can be difficult to determine which weapon or armor piece needs upgraded. He said this was an issue in the prior game, but it was more complicated in the sequel.</p>
    <h2>Sales</h2>
    <p class="container">The PlayStation 5 version of God of War Ragnarök was the third bestselling retail game during its first week of release in Japan, with 29,377 physical copies being sold. The PlayStation 4 version was the sixth bestselling retail game in the country throughout the same week, selling 11,260 physical copies. In the United Kingdom (UK), although the exact sales numbers were not revealed, it was reported that Ragnarök sold more physical copies on its first day than any previous God of War title did in their first week, with 82% of the total sold on PS5 and 18% on PS4. Of the PS5 sales, 12% came from the PS5 bundles. Additionally, it sold 51% more in its first week than the 2018 installment did. This made Ragnarök the biggest launch in the series in the UK, which was largely due to it being the first cross-gen release in the series. In terms of physical copies, it was the country's second biggest launch of the year, behind FIFA 23, and it had a bigger launch than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Elden Ring, and Pokémon Legends: Arceus. By the end of 2022, 670,617 copies of the game had been sold in the UK, making it the sixth best selling game of the year in the country. Ragnarök became the fastest-selling first-party game in PlayStation history, selling 5.1 million units in its opening week. In Germany, the game had sold more than 200,000 copies by the end of December 2022. By February 1, 2023, the game had sold 11 million copies worldwide.</p>
